### Fine-Tune Your Own AI

The core feature of LocalLM is its powerful fine-tuning capability. While other tools let you chat with generic models, LocalLM empowers you to create something uniquely yours.

- **Emulate Your Style:** Train an AI on your own writings—be it emails, articles, or notes—to create a model that sounds and thinks just like you.
- **Create an Expert:** Feed the model specialized knowledge on any topic, from legal documents to your personal codebase, creating an expert assistant for any niche.
- **Complete Privacy:** Because everything runs locally on your machine, your data and conversations remain completely private and secure.

The project is currently in development. Stay tuned for the first release!
