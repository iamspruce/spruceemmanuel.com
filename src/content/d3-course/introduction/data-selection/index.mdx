D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for creating dynamic,
interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
It uses HTML, SVG, and CSS
to bring data to life.

## Why Use D3?

D3 gives you complete control over the visualization:

### Data Binding

D3 binds data to DOM elements and applies data-driven transformations.

### DOM Manipulation

Direct control over SVG and HTML elements for custom visualizations.
