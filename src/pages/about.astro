      I started playing with code back in 2016 out of curiosity. I'd break a few
      things, make a few things, and then write about the whole process. You can
      read some of my articles over on <a
        href="https://freecodecamp.org/news/spruce">freeCodeCamp</a
      >.

      I am based in Nigeria and I like to work remotely. I also play chess; my
      Lichess username is <a

    <p><em>...but I suppose that’s not why you're here.</em></p>

      You'll want to know the specifics. I've worn a few hats over the years,
      including "writer" and "developer," but it all boils down to building
      useful things. I've had the pleasure of working with some great companies
      and teams.
    </p>

    <p>Here’s a snapshot of my recent journey:</p>

        <strong>Freelance</strong> | <em>Web Developer & Technical Writer</em> (2023
        - Present)
        <p>
          These days, I'm back to freelancing—working on web projects and
          writing technical content for clients. It's a mix of building things,
          documenting them, and helping teams ship better products. This has
          involved breaking down complex dev tools into readable content for
          companies like Hit-Subscribe.

        <strong>Professional Data Skills</strong> | <em>Technical Writer</em> (Jan
        - Dec 2024)
        <p>
          I got to work with content teams from some big tech names like
          CrowdStrike, Toptal, and SitePoint. My role was to translate dense
          technical information into developer-focused documentation and
          tutorials that actually make sense.

        <strong>ContentLab</strong> | <em>Web Developer & Technical Writer</em> (Apr
        2022 - Jan 2024)
        <p>
          Here, I split my time between code and content. When I wasn’t writing,
          I was building accessible web applications with the dev team for
          companies like Zoho, Kinsta, TomTom, Cohere, and even Meta, with a
          heavy focus on WCAG compliance.

        <strong>The Early Days</strong> | <em>Web Developer</em> (2018 - 2021)
        <p>
          This period was a mix of my first freelance gigs and a role as a
          Frontend Developer at Compass Software. I handled everything from
          talking to clients to design implementation and deployment. It’s where
          I really learned how to ship things on my own.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Through my work, I've had the opportunity to contribute to and be
      published on top developer blogs, including content for <strong
        >CrowdStrike, Toptal, SitePoint, Kinsta, Zoho, and Meta</strong
      >.

        My focus is always on producing and implementing high-quality,
