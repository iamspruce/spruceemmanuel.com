      I started playing with code back in 2016 out of curiosity. I'd break and
      make a few things, and then I'd write about breaking and making a few
      things. You can read some of my articles over on <a
        href="https://freecodecamp.org/news/spruce">Freecodecamp</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am based in Nigeria and I like to work remotely. I also play chess; my
      Lichess username is <a href="#" target="_blank">SpruceEmma</a>.
    </p>

    <p><em>...but I suppose that’s not why you're here.</em></p>

    <p>
      You'll want to know specifics about my work. Since 2016, I have had a few
      job titles, including "writer" and "developer," but it all boils down to
      making things. In the last 7+ years, I've had the pleasure of working with
      some great companies.

    <p>Here’s a snapshot:</p>

      <li>
        <strong>ContentLab</strong> | <em>Content Strategist</em> (Apr 2022 - 2025)
        <p>
          I spent my time here designing and building proof-of-concept
          applications with React.js and Next.js to break down complex
          engineering topics. I also produced clean, efficient code for tools
          and apps that set the standard for our technical articles, and I led
          the technical review for over 100 of them to ensure everything was up
          to snuff.

        <strong>Professional Data Skills</strong> | <em
          >Software Engineer & Documentation Expert</em
        > (Oct 2023 - 2025)
        <p>
          My main role was to translate dense technical information into
          developer-focused documentation that was actually easy to read. This
          involved defining software requirements with our internal teams and
          building out code examples to make our instructional content clearer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Freelance</strong> | <em>Software Engineer & Consultant</em> (2017
        - Present)
        <p>
          I've engineered and deployed robust, full-stack web applications for a
          wide range of clients, focusing on scalable front-end systems using
          React.js. I've also written and published over 50 detailed technical
          guides on platforms like freeCodeCamp.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While working, I've had the opportunity for some of my articles to be
      published on top developer blogs like the <strong
        >WhatsApp blog, CrowdStrike, Kinsta, and Zoho</strong
      >.
